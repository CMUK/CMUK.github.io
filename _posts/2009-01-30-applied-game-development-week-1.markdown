A new semester and a new module Applied Game Development is all about simulating the games industry and working in a team using the middleware game engine Gamebryo which is what fallout 3 and Oblivion was made using. We have been allocated our teams of which i am part of team of 6. Our project is:

**‘Exciting 3D Racing-game’ Requirements v0.1.1 **
\*\*
\*\*_1. The game should feature a vehicle that can travel at high speeds._

_2. There should be a number of other vehicles in the game with which you compete._

_3. It should be possible to sustain and inflict damage onto vehicles._

_4. Damage inflicted on vehicles should impact their performance._

_5. It will be necessary to fuel your vehicle at various intervals._

_6. If your vehicle runs out of fuel you should need to be assisted to continue._

_7. There should be at least two modes of play._

_8. There should be a vehicle upgrade facility._

_9. The game should be controlled via the XBox360 controller._

_10. Players need to dodge environment obstacles at times._

_11. The game must be in 3D._

These requirements are not set in stone neither are the teams we have been warned of changes and expect the requirements to change half way through. As a team we have come up with some great ideas for a racing game we had an hour meeting and wrote down all the ideas and assigned roles. At the moment we have 2 game designers,1 lead programmer,1 researcher,1 physics programmer and me the project manager. We have gone with a basic approach to begin with we want to meet the requirements and make a basic game and then implement our ideas. This will help if the requirements get changed as we will have our basic 3d racing game.

As as a team we are all really enthusiastic and taking a very professional approach to it. We have already had 2 meeting and been working as a team for the past 3 days in the labs. We have made progress working through the gamebryo tutorials and even managed to change the camera on a 3D helicopter sample. The hardest thing was setting up visual studio to work with gamebryo it required adding lots of library's and changing a lot paths. We are confident with our project and ideas as its my role to do project management i got to start straight away and made a PERT chart ,Work Break Down structures and some basic milestones. The current plan is to have something controlled with the 360 controller on screen for next week. During the project we have to pitch our ideas in front of a panel of people from games industry with someone coming from Frontier Developments.
