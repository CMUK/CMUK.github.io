This week we looked at Developing methodologies. We looked at the waterfall method of developing which as the name suggests is a sequential development process. One task leads onto another and flows down like a waterfall. Starting with the Requirements specification once complete you move onto the Design stage and then onto the Implementing or coding stage. This model can be effective in the wayÂ  you spend along time on the design and getting a strong design document together when it comes to implementing should make a program easier to integrate as everything should have been well thought out in the design document. It uses Big Design Up Front (BDUF) in which it relies heavily on documentation so new team members can understand it and each stage being completely finished before proceeding. The watefall method has its flaws, your not always going to know the requirments at the start of a project and is impossible to completely finish a stage.

Another method is Rapid application development (RAD) this is based on creating prototypes and frameworks. This method has advantages over others as the name sugests its rapid and doesnt need much time to build a quick prototype. You also write test cases and perform unit testing.

Extreme Programming This involves working in pairs on the same problem. There is no upfront design documents you work on the fly. The downside is you are keeping two developers on same task
