This week’s task is to remake the university in unreal. We each have to individually create a part of the university and then at the end we will combine all our parts to form one big level. My group was assigned to the making the Atrium which is the heart of the university. It has a few shops, a ramp going up to another floor, a cafeteria sandwich shop; it also connects to the library and SU bar. My task was to remake blends the coffee shop and the heap lecture theatre I found this quite easy as I had been doing more complex stuff in my famous five game but I am looking forward to seeing the final level when everyone’s parts are merged.

During the lecture/practical we had to do an elevator pitch on our game with only 5 mins planning and to pitch this to a small group I found this quite interesting as it made me pick out my main selling points and after presenting I received some valuable feedback. After this we looked at our schedules and looked at the better schedule in our class which helped me to improve mine. I rewrote my whole schedule and broke down tasks even further. I also added more detailed information such as tasks remaining and hours remaining which will help me stay more focused on the schedule. I also put a percent complete for every task with some conditional formatting to show 4 colours which change depending on percent completed.

Over the weekend I have been spending most my time with my famous five level. I spent along time on Saturday adding static meshes and texturing my rooms in the lighthouse this gave it a nice feel and atmosphere compared to before where it was just like a jail cell cold feeling. I made my puzzle rooms and caves and then my map corrupted. It gave some really odd results to begin with it was just the vertex editor that would move my brush to the bottom right and then objects I had placed such as a light was invisible but still had the light effect and then finally my level started going see through. I looked desperately on the internet for a solution with the only one being to export and import into a new file this crashes when I tried. I had been saving every few minutes however I had been working on the save file 1.2 so I had lost all my work and had to load save file 1.1 which was a 3 hour old version. It doesn’t sound like a lot 3 hours but it still was a huge pain having to redo things again but at least the fear of losing work shall make me keep saving different versions in the future.
