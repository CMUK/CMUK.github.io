This week we looked at different **Design Paterns**. A design pattern is a certain way of solving a problem that we expereince over time. They get refined over time and become a standard approach.In Object Orientated programming there is 3 main categories:

Creational - These relate to creating instances of classes

Structural - These relate to the relationship between Classes or Objects

Behavioural - these relate to communication between classes or objects

Singleton - This is a creational pattern which is often used. It is used to make a class **global** and to make it have only one **instance**. A typical example would be a keyboard input class for a game.

Facade - This provides an easy to user interface which wraps up functionality from other classes. Provides flexibility and makes the code more easy to read.

This week we were supposed to have frontier come down on the Wednesday to look at our games unfortunately they couldnâ€™t make it so we got feedback off other lecturers. This went really well for my group we got lots of feedback and left a good impression. We had a lecturer from the computer games modelling and animation course come and see how the art was being used in our game and asked us a few questions about the design and look of the game. On the technical side of things we were asked about how the physics would work and a few questions on collision. This week we managed to implment hovering on the car, collision working in the test level,Projectile class and some scripting.
