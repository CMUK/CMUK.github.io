So over the summer 09 I decided to look into flash action script for game development, Having only used flash in the past to make a presentation I had very little knowledge of flash. I had some great ideas for games but had no idea what I was limited too and how long it would take to learn some of the more advanced game techniques for flash. I decided to start simple and make a puzzle game, I wanted to make a bejewelled clone but with the board being able to rotate and flip to give it a unique _spin_. I looked on various websites and got some books on action script, I was surprised at how quickly it was to pick up. I had gone through some basic tutorials and figured out a lot with trial and error, within a week I had the core basic mechanics done allowing you to swap with neighbouring cells on click. After 4 weeks the game was completed, I had two special powerups which you get from matching 3 of the rare gems. Shifting a row across or shifting a column up or down, 2 modes of play Arcade/Time trials.

After receiving an email from a lecturer about a flash game competition I decided to enter it and modify my game slightly to fit the theme. The competition was run by Arriva buses they were looking for a bus themed game. I replaced the gems in my game with buses and made the powerups bus themed so clearing 3 rows with a bus swiping across the screen. I got a phone call today to say I had won the competition, I couldn’t believe it, from what started as just a simple venture into flash to being the winner of the competition I’m over the moon :). The game will be available on the company’s website soon. I will post a link to it here.
