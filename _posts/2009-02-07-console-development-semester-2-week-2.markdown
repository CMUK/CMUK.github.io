This week we learnt more about optimising we looked at a new tool called **proDG** This tool enabled us to see graphicaly how much our optimisations had on the psp. It allows you to capute data from the psp and analyse it. We used it for our orizuru program which is a simple application which adds oragami bird to the screen using the circle button and removes them using x button. We were able to see the perfomance of using the original programme and our optimised struct reordered version. we are still not sure if we are getting the right results as the results seemed to happen on later frames. We measured how many origami birds were on screen and found out our optimised version had fewer instruction cache misses. We also noticed the frame completes faster
