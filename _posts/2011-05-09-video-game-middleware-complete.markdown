After 12 weeks of working with Gamebryo 2.5 I finished creating a small game to show off some of the middleware used. The game last 10 minutes and allows the player to explore and complete quests in any order.
I managed to use 8 different middlewares created by other colleagues and also implemented 3 external middlewares.

**Internal**
Text effects, Quest System, Hint system, Snapshot, Time of Day, Camera system, String database, Inventory system

**External**
Text to speech (SAPI)
DirectDraw video player
FMOD

Here is a video of the game in action it shows a complete walkthrough and shows the functionality of all the middlewares.
