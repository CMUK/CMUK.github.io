This week I have been putting a lot of time into Game Dev. I have now finally got a torch in my game this took a lot of effort and required lots of time looking on forum posts. It does however have a slight bug with it when it shines on certain objects. I also spent the majority of the time coding my inventory from scratch. I did look into extending the unreal Inventory but I found I was spending too much time not getting anywhere so I went for a quick fix and wrote my own. It works just the same and is dynamic. I also made a quick inventory select at the bottom right of the screen saving the user from going into the inventory it also holds the last picked up item which is handy. The list can be scrolled left and right with the LB and RB button on the 360 controller. Some of my puzzles require the item to be used on them such as the magnifying glass will reveal hidden objects and clues on maps and notes when equipped. I made my door now need the key item to open this was writing done by writing a scripted trigger that checked the inventory for the key. If the key gets pickedup in a different order and a different slot in the inventory it will check for it. I also added a crowbar into my game which will be used for one of the initial puzzles. The game is coming together nicely now and feels like it is starting to become something I am confident it will turn out great. I will be focusing more on the tunnels next week and move away from the initial lighthouse start. Check the screenshots below for the inventory and torch working the artwork is not final for the inventory
