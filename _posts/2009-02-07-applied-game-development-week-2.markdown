This week I have seen a definite improvement over last week; there have been a few problems but work wise we have achieved a lot. The start of the week I called an emergency meeting to sort things out. I hired a room out in the library and went through the agenda. I had a serious discussion about project and problems that have come up. By the end of the meeting everyone knew what to do and what I wanted to be done for this week. We also got assigned our artists and i arranged a meeting with them. My teams lead designer went over the design document with the lead artists and we had two very contrasting ideas. The artists seemed willing to go with our idea and have promised us as a basic low poly ship model and some concept art for next week. We have also agreed to have a weekly meeting with the artists.

We all worked more hours than last week and stayed till 8pm on Wednesday. I have had to reduce the hours slightly as i don’t want other work to suffer. There have been a few issues with team members this week mainly communication problems, but I have dealt with them and as a team we are working better and remain optimistic about the project. We also managed to hit the target hours this week.

The lead programmer has made the framework from scratch so we are no longer relying on tutorial samples. This has caused a few headaches this week as a function appeared to be exactly the same but never worked, we tracked down the problem and fixed it but it set us behind schedule. I can’t discuss what it was on here as other teams may see it so i will mainly be blogging about working in a team and the progress of the project.
