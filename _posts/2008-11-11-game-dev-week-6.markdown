This weeks game dev i have been looking more at unreal script. I have sorted out my timer mini game to trigger whenever i want. I have spent many hours looking up dynamic lights for a torch in my game but at the moment is seems very unlikely i will get one in. I also been implementing an inventory class this is taking sometime to get in and still isn't working properly i am about half through sorting it out. I managed to get it to display the name of gun when using the loaded cheat and cycling between guns it is showing the weapon inventory working just a case of extending this and getting my items to go in this pickup inventory class. I also got my key working with the door this was coding a use trigger that only opens the door when the key has been picked up this was confusing at first as i am used to doing it through unrealEd. coding it turned out simpler than i first thought. I also added my own loading screen and have been looking at the different DXT texture compressions.
