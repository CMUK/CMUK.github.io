Gear Fit Camera uses the following permission: android.permission.CAMERA

By allowing this permission you are giving the application access to the built in camera

The application only uses the camera to take a photo when requested by the user via button press on the watch.

There is no concern for privacy as the app does not use any third party libraries or use any user information
