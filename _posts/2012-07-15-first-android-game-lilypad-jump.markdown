After two months of working on an android game I have finally finished, LilyPad Jump is a fun, addictive tap to jump game with the goal being to get as far as you can in distance, I came up with the theme of frogs after looking at existing games on the google android store, there is hardly any frog themed games at the moment, the next step was to come with some addictive gameplay, having looked and played some of the best sellers on the android store I started to notice a theme of simple tap mechanics with never-ending scrolling games, these seem to be the most popular and provide the hook to keep your playing, the never-ending conveyor belt system employed in these games keep you trying to beat your personal best. I also wanted to make something not serious but really casual and easy to play for quick attention spans.

The coding behind the game is very simple java using the game engine Andengine, Andengine is very nice to work with and has great community support, I have heavily optimised the game to get a nice smooth frame rate on my galaxy ace its averaging at 95fps.

I used scoreLoop to create online/offline leaderboards, while to begin with I was unsure about using scoreLoop the main issue I had was I didn't want all the features that are built-in, I just wanted plain simple leaderboards. After implementing scoreLoop I started to run into many problems with it, A lot I had to change the source code and model it to my game layout, the result has been worth it and would definetly recommend scoreLoop and be using it in future android games.

LilyPad Jump is available now for only £0.69p from [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilypadjump](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilypadjump)
