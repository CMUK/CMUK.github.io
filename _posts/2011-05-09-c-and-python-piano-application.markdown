title: C# and Python Piano Application
categories:
  - Platforms and Tools
---

In the module Languages, Platforms and Tools I learnt a new language of my choice (Python) in 12 weeks and compared the differences to C#. I chose to write a piano application which teaches the user to play basic songs at note level. Python was enjoyable to learn and both programs are identical in functionality and appearance.

The piano application loads and saves to an SQL database with the pre set songs and also the user recorded songs. Below is a video of it in action:
