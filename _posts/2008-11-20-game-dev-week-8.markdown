Player Experience

In my famous five game the players experience will change over how far you progress. You will start off playing as Julian and be locked in the lighthouse. The main goal throughout the game is to find a way out of the lighthouse. You will need to find clues, Talk to the others and solve puzzles in order to get out. The first half of the game is about gathering items and clues in the lighthouse. You will need to use items to solve the puzzles on searching for clues the player will find a map that shows a hidden tunnel down below the lighthouse. Once you get down into the tunnel below the players experience will change as you find out there is treasure hidden in the caves. You will want to find the treasure and doing so will require puzzles to be worked out to get to other bits of the tunnel. These puzzles will be more physical with objects being pushed and logical puzzles to be solved. After the player has solved the puzzles the player will be faced with a giant maze with the treasure room at the end of it. Once the player has found the gold you will then go back to your main goal which is finding a way out. On your way back to the lighthouse you will be faced with bad guys roaming around the tunnels looking for the gold this will make the players experience more action based with sneaking and evading the bad guys around the tunnels.
