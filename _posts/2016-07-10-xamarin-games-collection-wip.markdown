Xamarin recently became free, I was eager to get developing and see what it has to offer. Having owned a lot of video games throughout my life I decided to create a collection app that allows you to search a database of games and mark the game as "Owned".

Goals:

Hybrid Web App - Work on web desktop/android.
MVC/Razor - allow for portable .net libraries to be used.
Sync - must sync across devices using a cloud solution, tablets/phones/web.
Database - sqlite must have collection of all video games from commodore to very latest release on consoles. must allow updating its library with latest releases.
Responsive - must fit mobile, tablet and desktop.

After a month of working on it I am pleased with the progress made and have stable prototype of my app:

[gallery ids="745,746" type="columns"]

Xamarin is excellent to work with by developing in visual studio, C# and MVC I felt right at home, previously I would be working in java on android studio with webview loading html pages.

Performance is good loading in thousands of games and scrolling through the list easily, most of the goals have been met but I will be carrying on with this project and have exciting things lined up. Here is a sneak peak of the app working:
