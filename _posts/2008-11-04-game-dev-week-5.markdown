This weeks game dev i have been implementing items into my game. I have taken last weeks pickup mini game and turned it into a gold collecting game to get the player to explore the level. I then implemented a working Magnifying glass this works quite well and will be used to in a number places or on objects. I then implemented a key however ive not made it work with my door yet im still getting to grips with unreal script. I tried to implement an inventory system but it doesnt work just yet im still playing about with it. I should get it done by next week and be able to drop/pickup items and switch between the items in the inventory. I have played about with getting names to show above items following a tutorial however this was for ut2003 and had slight difference in the classes and names i fixed this but its still not there yet. I have tried to implemented a bot character that should follow me about but at the moment it does what it wants looking through the log files it appears it cant see me so i will try and get this working for next week. Check out my screenshots of items and the mini game pickups working.
