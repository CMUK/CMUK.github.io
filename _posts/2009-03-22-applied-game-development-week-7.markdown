This week we got projectiles firing in game. This was great to see as we had a lot of troubles getting it to fire in the right direction. We have tiny XML working its loading profiles and weapon information in the form of unit testing. Barry got some basic AI working following nodes about the level. I spent most of Wednesday with the horrible task of merging two build together. I looked at SVNs merge function but it wouldn't work properly. So i had to get an old build on one screen and the new build on the other and go line by line through the code looking for the differences. This shouldn’t have happened as we are meant to be working from the latest build in the weekly build folder I have stressed this to the team that this cannot happen again as it wastes too much time and sometimes doesn’t work. After last week’s talk about the level looking a bit primitive I got onto the artists and will have the new track hopefully loading in the next week. We are still stuck on the collision thing but the artists are going to sort it out for us.
