For the past 2 weeks i have been preparing for the demo scene presentations. We were given the task to create a small demo in the language of C with restrictions to 4kb ofÂ  non-lib .data/.rodata. For this i wanted to recreate the game of life which i did in the first year in C# however i ended up creating a random graphics visualiser. I played about with the rand() function and got it drawing triangles, grid lines and stars all completely random. I then made the triangles 3D and got them rotating on different axis depending on the method called by the random number. The triangles also scale up and down and change colours at different times. Most of what i had created came from trial and error of trying to make the game of life. I will get some screen captures of my demo running and post them here. We showed off our creations and got marked in different categories. I came second for the best graphics which was great considering other people had some colourful demos. I also won the smallest file size with my demo being just half a kilobyte. After the demo scene we were given our assignment which is a real demo scene with some more restrictions we are now assessed on what we make and have a 1kb limit and It has to run at 30 frames a second.
