LilyPad Jump uses the following permission: android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE

By allowing this permission you are giving the application access to device state

The application uses the device state to determine if your phone rings while the game is running, it then mutes the game so you are not interupted by the sound or music

There is no concern for privacy as the application does not use any user information
