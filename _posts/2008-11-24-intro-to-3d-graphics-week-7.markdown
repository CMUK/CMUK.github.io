I haven't done an update on this in 2 weeks but i have made a lot of progress since the last update i now have flat shading on my models, Point light,Ambient and Directional lights in my scene. I also got it shading different colours depending on the lights colour it reflects some of the colour.

Basic ambient light                                 Directional Light
