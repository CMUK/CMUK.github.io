After a hard 11 weeks ive finally finished my software renderer I am very pleased with the outcome and as i have finished term time i will still be working on it and get texturing finished. This final week I focused on the user interface and added controls to show the features of the render, with the many different lighting mode and rendering modes. I added a preview mode which cycles through the different modes at intervals, a random mode which cycles through a random rendering and lighting mode which changes the models RGB values. I added another model on screen which i re wrote the render model method to take in the model in the parameters. This allowed me to make my code look neater and extendible for more models on screen. I looked at the open dialogue on MSDN and put in opening a model into my render allowing the user to load in any .MD2 model. I am pleased with the way the projects gone, it has been a really tough 12 weeks and has really pushed my programming ability. I got behind at around week 5 but managed to keep up i have still got to add texturing which is half done but should be done in the next few weeks.
