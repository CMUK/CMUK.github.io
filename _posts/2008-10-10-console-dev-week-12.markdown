Over past 2 weeks i have been looking at the architecture of old consoles. Working in groups we dissected the original playstation we looked at the motherboard and found out where the CPU,GPU,Memory and sound chips were. We then looked up the the specification and did some comparisons to the N64. We looked at early tech demos showing what the hardware was capable of and found out poly counts and CPU speeds. We presented to the class our findings. We then looked at all the consoles CPUs and found some had similar architecture with the playstation being MIPS R3000A which is similar architecture as the N64 uses. We then had a presentation on the basics behind machine programming and looked at what MIPS is and PSP assembly language.
