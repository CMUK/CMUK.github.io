We had our first lecture on the Mobile Devices module. This was brief overview of the module and have an assignment to Design and develop a mobile application focused on a particular line of business. As we are working on mobile device we will be using the language java most of us have no experience of java so it should intresting to learn and develop on another platform and language.

We have started from the basics and gone through a tutorial on writing a hello world application from here i went on to complete this weeks task which was to create the dice game "Dead Dice" in which the user inputs the ammount of dice to play with and rolls the dice. if the die rolled is a 2 or a 5 then it becomes dead and gets removed the remaining dice get added together to give a score. The remaining dice get rolled again. the game ends when all dice have become dead.

After doing so much C# in the first year and getting used to converting to java i manged to do it quite quickly. We had a console.java class which helped alot as we could use C# type commands such as Console.ReadInt(); and write line functions. Using netbeans to program in i found it to be useful as when typing a keyword it would give a definition of how to use and what it does. We had an hour lecture on java and looked at it from a business spin such as developing an application on CLDC 1.0 rather than 1.1 as more devices areÂ  still using 1.0 and the only difference is you lose the ability for floating point numbers although there are ways around using floating point numbers in 1.0 by storing the decimals in variables.
