Remember the famous five by Enid Blyton? course you do :) well i have been given the task to remake a famous five book into a game in under 12 weeks how hard can it be? well we are using the popular game engine Unreal Tournament. The unreal engine is very popular in gaming industry cutting development time and costs down it is also very powerful and quite easy to use. I will be remaking the book Famous Five go to demon rocks. So why did i chose this book well having read three others i found this one to most interesting from a development view i have come up with some awesome ideas in my design document i have been a bit optimistic with the project and want some very cool features in my game. The chapter i am recreating is about the famous five getting trapped in a lighthouse and finding a trap door down to some caves which contain treasure they run into two smugglers and get chased in the maze like caves. I will be writing in unreal script which is like the language C and Java. This week i have made a very detailed schedule to to help with the project management and will be used and update each week to show how much is possible. I have already read 600 pages of the Mastering unreal book and done all 3D buzz tutorials and feeling confident with the UnrealEd. I have started making my basic map layout check out the screenies below
