This weeks console dev was about the PSP dev kits which was a nice break from MIPS. We started off by looking at linux and GNU based command line. This was different as being used to windows for so long it took a while to understand there file structure and different commands. We used Cygwin Bash Shell which is a linux command prompt which works in windows. It maps onto the drives and can access all the folder it just creates like a shortcut. The functionality was similar to windows dos with directory listings and changing directorys however the keywords are different such as "ls" is the same as "dir" in windows dos. After learning the changes we created a hello word source inside Cygwin and managed to compile and run it through the Cygwin command prompt. We then compiled it for the PSP using psp-gcc and actually got it running on the screen through PSP debugger program but not on the PSP console. We were still able to look at the code and turn on the MIPS to see the hello world working.
