This weeks intro to 3D i fixed my gauraud shading. The problem i was getting was due to my interpolation calculation it was interpolating by the Y values but not the X values. The calculation i was using was the same one as my flat shading with my own rasteriser. To fix this i re did my interpolation calculation but a longer way finding out the difference and the gradient.
