**Year in industry**

I’ve just completed a year in industry working on a MotoGP 09/10 for 360/PS3 as part of my work placement year, What a crazy year it’s been I joined in crunch and left in crunch, the words baptism of fire come to mind, It has been a really amazing experience and one that has opened my eyes to the games industry in many ways, You don’t just learn about the game you learn about teamwork, communication, scheduling, everything. I’ve seen QA side of things, fixed bugs, learnt about community, worked on DLC and the processes of xbl, I’ve seen pitches, documentation, alpha, beta, launch, been in meetings and met some of the hardest working dedicated people and also made some great friends along the way.

**Side projects**

As for being very busy over the past year I’ve not had as much time as I hoped for to get on with some side projects, I did try near the start of my placement but ended up dedicating all my time to motogp, When the game launched I wasn’t under so much pressure so I got a few projects going outside of work, First off I started experimenting with XNA and physics engines, this was really interesting and I managed to get a 3D incredible machine type game up and running with the camera fixed side on like 2D, I will definitely be returning to this project soon. The next thing I did was I went back to my de blob game, I continued to improve it and to refresh my knowledge of DirectX again, I got an orbit camera implemented and bill boarding. The next project was flash action script 3.0 the latest version, this was different to AS 2.0 which I had been making flash games in, The main differences are the Object Orientated approach I struggled at first picking up AS 3.0 not because of the OO but because it is such a huge change from 2.0 basic things like keywords had all been changed I found this really frustrating however I stuck with it and got a small point and clicker up and running called The Forest, Its currently at about 60% finished as its quite a huge project more than I thought due to sheer amount of puzzles and environments. Taking a step back I returned to AS 2.0 in the hope I could port from AS 2.0 to AS 3.0 of my buster game, after spending many hours and having too many errors it wouldn’t display I gave up with it, I decided just to improve and implement features I didn’t have enough time to do. Currently im looking more into directX animation and AI.
