This week has been a tough week one person in our team was ill however we achieved quite a lot we got collision in but have not wrote the response yet, I have been working on a ship class which is nearly complete, The other members have been trying to get text on screen so we can use it for debugging at this stage. A weapons and projectiles class is being made. We had to make a decision about terrain we looked at the pros and cons of getting terrain in and decided it would be a waste of time we havenâ€™t completely dismissed it but for the time being it being held off. The scene graph is easy enough to make terrain in its just the loading of the file type would require a lot of work and time.

We have also been informed the artists are making the terrain and environment and will be using .NIF format which we made a loader for last week. We had a meeting with the artists and were very impressed with the concepts and new ideas they had. We have changed our art style slightly and have given the artists a deadline to make us 4 or 5 ships and a test level for next Wednesday morning. We also have to do a one slide pitch of our ideas next Thursday.

Overall i feel we are starting to get into a routine and things are happing faster i did hope to have a car on a track this week but we have all been coding our own things and hope to bring them together next week and have multiple objects on screen.
