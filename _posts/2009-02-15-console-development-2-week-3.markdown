Following on from last week we carried on using proDB to analyse our optimisations. There was no lecture this week we just spent more time gathering more results and comparing the optimisations. We found out instruction cache misses had decreased with our optimisation only by a small amount, we also found out the frame completes faster than without optimisation again only by a small amount. We and everyone else in the group had troubles with proDB it seems give no results for the first few frames and gives the data near the end frames.
